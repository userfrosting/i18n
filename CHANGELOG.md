# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.4.1]
- Throws an exception if `translate` placeholder are not numeric or array.
- Fix issue with numeric placeholder with non plural keys. See [userfrosting#1090](https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/1090#issuecomment-620832985).

## [4.4.0]
Complete rewrite of the Translator.

Instead of `LocalePathBuilder -> MessageTranslator`, the new translator introduce the concept of `Locale`, `Dictionary` and `Translator`. So now you create a locale, which enables you to create a dictionary for that locale, which finally allows you to create a translator which will used that dictionary.

Instead of loading multiple locale on top of each other, a locale can depend on other locale using the configuration file (ie. `locale.yaml`). See the updated doc for more information.

Plural rule are now defined in the locale configuration file instead of the special `@PLURAL_RULE` key.

All methods of the `Translator` are the same for backward compatibility. The only change is the constructor, which now requires a `DictionaryInterface` instance.

**Detailed changes** :
- `MessageTranslator` is now `Translator`.
- `Translator` requires a `DictionaryInterface` as some constructor argument instead of paths.
- `LocalePathBuilder` removed.
- `DictionaryInterface` now extends `UserFrosting\Support\Repository\Repository` instead of the `Translator`. The raw data can be accessed using the Dictionary methods.
- `@PLURAL_RULE` special key removed. Use the Locale configuration file (`locale.yaml`) `plural_rule` attribute instead.
- Translator can't load multiple locale anymore. Use the Locale configuration file `parents` attribute instead.

See updated [documentation](README.md) for more details on how to use the new Translator, Locale and Dictionary.
